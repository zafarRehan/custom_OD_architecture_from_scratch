# custom One - Stage Object Detector from scratch

One stage object detectors are the perfect ones which predicts with high accuracy as well as high speed.
The most famous One Stage detectors are SSD and YOLO family. 
A comparision between slight differences which they have and their overall working is explained here:  https://machinethink.net/blog/object-detection. I would highly recommend beginners as well as experienced ones to freshen up their concepts before proceeding with the <a href="full_object_detection_code.ipynb">Notebook</a>


## Classes
